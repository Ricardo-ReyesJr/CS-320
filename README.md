Final Project
- I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by simultaneously working on chunks of code. checking for my syntax and spelling. After that, I check for any bugs I can catch before testing. I then would follow by doing a test with JUnit and Maven.
- After taking notes on what was provided by the client and users. I will incorporate what was requested to the best of my understanding. Changes will be made as the user or client requests.
- I love UI/UX I try to approach the aesthetics of the design and what would be simple, aesthetically pleasing, and as user-friendly as possible.
